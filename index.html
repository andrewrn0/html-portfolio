            <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I've been fortunate to do a ton of cool things, and thats made me into a pretty curious
                person. Currently that's causing me to learn web development, so I made this vanilla html/css/js site
                for practice. </p>

            <p>I plan on showcasing my software projects and other things of interest here. My favorite color is orange.
            </p>

            <p> If you're looking for my professional qualifications, my resume is <a
                    href="./assets/resume_20240816.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Now?</h2>
            <p>Currently I am in home in Alaska for the first summer in 8 years. I've been inside coding more than I
                thought I would be this summer... but luckily I got outside and picked up
                packrafting this summer, a longtime goal. </p>

                learning.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>I'd like to eventually post photos or video of these outings, but haven't made the time.</p>
